This life simulation is my experiment with creating neural networks. Each organism has its own brain, in which input, internal, and output neurons are randomly generated to decide the organism's movement. 

Although this is an extremely simple simulation, this took a lot of work to create, as it is my first time creating a neural network.

All in all, this was an extremely fun, satisfying, and fulfilling project to create.
